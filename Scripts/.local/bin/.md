Old Thoughts
============

Comparison of Non linear wiki discussions [[Notetaking]{.smallcaps}]{.tag tag-name="Notetaking"} {#comparison-of-non-linear-wiki-discussions}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\<2019-11-02 Sat\> \[2019-11-02 Sat 19:44\]

Other people have also liked the non linear nature of *OneNote* and
*Evernote* However they lament the obvious problems with both:

### Problems

-   Resource intensive
-   non portable
-   proprietary and untrustworthy
-   really complicated
-   limited support for
-   Code
    -   mathematics
        -   although with vim, markdown, org mode etc. you lose the
            benefit of drawing you can include *PNG* and *PDF* files so
            it\'s only really a minor loss.

What to do
----------

So what first needs to happen is acknowledging that there will be Many
different types of documents as notes at least what\'s listed below.

What I need to do is get all notes in one place and then implement a
searching and filtering mechanism, now what I\'d rather is unending tags
as an help and then use interlinked markdown files in the single
directory linking to each other (using the `gf` shortcut in vim to open
links.

It\'s possible that [*VimWiki*](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)
would make this easier, previewing files can be achieved with a pandoc
compilation, although then the problem is previewing as I click through
them which is a nuisance.

`Org mode` May have stricter definitions and that may make this whole
interlinking affair a little simpler. There\'s nothing to So me
instituting vin wiki for other things and I can still institute my
typical vim bindings, ultimately I\'ve gotta get my notes in order and
anything else will be pouring lipstick on a pig.

### definite notes

-   HTML
-   PDF and or \*.tex
-   \*.md and or \*.org

### Probable Notes

-   .r and .rmd
-   .txt snippets
-   `.sh` scripts
-   im not sure how these would be notes but it may be such that they
    will be in a Notes directory.

### unlikely

-   Png
-   gif
-   maybe GeoGebra files
    -   these are ask things u may use as notes and I need to expect
        that to happen

Generally

Other people with similar issues
--------------------------------

I don\'t know whether preview would work with a vim wiki and how it
works in org mode but everybody on the vim subreddit swears by org mode
despite the preference for vim. At least in [this
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/arb94e/vim_notes_vim_wiki_or_emacs_orgmode/)
apparently [this video](https://youtu.be/SzA2YODtgK4) is worth watching
and it sounds like *spacemacs* fixed a lot of things.

I\'ll be honest though, I\'m not a massive fan of beorg because it
doesn\'t seem to offer very much over mweb really, I wonder if org mode
will integrate well with markdown and TeX filled though.

The general consensus is that for managing your notes as a wiki and or
markdown library is:

-   Vimwiki
    -   This actually sounds really nice
    -   I think however you would need an index file to tie everything
        together, but I love how it sounds
-   vim notes
    -   I don\'t know anything about this
-   org mode
    -   I like that this is an accepted standard
    -   I like that I can get HTML and PDF out of it, I like that I can
        create internal links

I could used vim wiki for something given how much I feel good about it
but it seems that org mode will do exactly what I want which is not
taking and management with acceptable export, for different types of
hours I can still implement markdown and full blown latex though. Ôøº
*init*

Accessing on iPad
-----------------

So *Dropbox*:

-   Will search PDF files
-   cant really open HTML files because it can\'t follow links
-   Readdle Documents is pretty good.

*Documents* will:

-   Search and preview PDF and HTML files

but neither will search `md` files:

*MWeb* Will:

-   Search and preview `md` files

Also you can use [*HackMD*](https://hackmd.io/).

Hack md supports tags in a game just like notable and will synch with a
`Git` repo, bear that in mind.

But generally having multiple formats in the notes directory may merely
be necessary.

Working copy would be ideal actually,

Testing TikZ

This is too much effort, just:

[IN-PROGRESS]{.todo .IN-PROGRESS} Can RStudio be a note taking app? {#can-rstudio-be-a-note-taking-app}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If I created a project of all my DataScience üß¨ work in notebooks, could
I use the Fuzzy Find Features and quick preview of Notebook files to use
it as a way to review all my past work?

TODO is there a way to display the Markdown output in the preview pane
with a saved preview in the folder?

Then it would basically do the job as a tool to peruse and preview past
work.

As a matter of fact I could put all my work in the same place and I\'d
never need to search for it to begin with. Ok So no I don\'t think it
can be a standalone notetaking app, per se.

BUT

using the `html_notebook` gives a really quick preview (and seems to
make LaTeX persistent) so I think it is well worth keeping all past
DataScience work all in one project to edit, review and draw upon in
conjunction with other notes.

so for example:

-   All Scripts and RMD Past work explained and laid out cleanly in an
    `rmd` project
-   Boostnote for pertinent snippets
    -   think like pacman, arima etc.
-   RawMD for more mathematically bent notes
-   Joplin where I really want to feel more organised with those notes
-   Org for a more full featured set of notes
-   LaTeX wouldn\'t be suitable for data science stuff relly

  ------------------ ------ -------------- ------------- -------------- -----------------

[DONE]{.todo .DONE} Is there an easy way to implement notebooks? {#is-there-an-easy-way-to-implement-notebooks}
----------------------------------------------------------------

If I did folders I could probably tee up a Joplin import export that
would work reasonably well

-   They will probably remain seperate note systems for seperate
    purposes
-   but this would make them more transferable.

If VSNotes or just plain VSCode is sufficiently well behaved then the
fact that Notable won\'t work well for folders doesn\'t matter too much

No folders will break image links, if you need folders I think you just
have to use Joplin.

If I can find a way to be careful with images nesting things into
notebooks could be a possiblility, one of the issues, as it stands, is
the Damn RMarkdown Notes, although, I could just give them there own
directory and then try and focus on just making notes with images all in
the same folder, hmmmm, the issue is being able to have them in
notebooks but be portable.

[TODO]{.todo .TODO} Index all Raw MD Notes {#index-all-raw-md-notes}
------------------------------------------

(Consider making an index file with org-brain?, you can just change the
link style or just use the HTML / org org-brain file.

Change `typora` image folder
----------------------------

I\'d rather /attachments over .assets

Paste Images
------------

### [DONE]{.todo .DONE} Can VSCode Paste Images {#can-vscode-paste-images}

Yeah just use the `paste-image` plug-in, best bit is that it will save
them in the root project directory or a relative folder, super useable!

### [DONE]{.todo .DONE} Can Mark Text Paste Images {#can-mark-text-paste-images}

Yep, and you can specify the directory int which to save the file which
is really nice

Browse Folders
--------------

### [DONE]{.todo .DONE} Can Mark Text Browser through a folder like Notable and VSCode? {#can-mark-text-browser-through-a-folder-like-notable-and-vscode}

Yes Marktext is a viable, if not superior, alternative to typora

[TODO]{.todo .TODO} Transcribe some math modelling tutorial problems into LaTeX and or markdown {#transcribe-some-math-modelling-tutorial-problems-into-latex-and-or-markdown}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you do this you\'ll probably rather

-   Use markdown live preview of tex
-   use org inline preview
-   use auctex inline previewIn that order

While doing this consider a workflow for transcribing physics problems
and the like (bearing in mind that more time needs to be spent drilling
practice tests).

Searching and Tagging Notes
---------------------------

-   I can implement `YAML` tags and file searching using *Notable* and
    [vsNotes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=patricklee.vsnotes)
-   Browsing with nested notebooks is a bit more difficult

Write Script to convert `md` to `org`
-------------------------------------

Using *this* `m20` script I can now take clipboard (`+`) markdown and
copy it straight into an `org` file, moreover I could also use `o2m` to
do it the other way as well

[TODO]{.todo .TODO} Transcribe Joplin Note {#transcribe-joplin-note}

So currently `org-mode` uses `XeLaTeX` in `org-mode` [By this
setting](~/.emacs.d/init.el::;%20Export%20using%20the%20'minted%20package%20(Using%20XeLaTeX))
and `AucTeX` uses `pdfLaTeX` [by this
setting](~/.emacs.d/init.el::;;;;;%20use%20shell-escape%20flag%20(withpdflatex))
because it\'s quicker [^1]

It\'s also necessary to use `synctex=1` in order to remove any unicode

It\'s a little clunky but If I run [this lisp

grab a screenshot will be prevented and I\'m good to go, not super ideal
but certainly workable.

It will be necessary to link to all PDF and markdown notes through an org index
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe with org brain, but I just can\'t think of any other way to browse
for notes that also include pdf files (because Joplin can\'t search
through attachments so you\'ll have to figure that out with a file
system. . )

The problem is more or less that *Joplin* cannot Fuzzy-Search and that
raw MDs can be browsed efficiently, folders would be ideal, but, dealing
with images will be a massive hassle, I just can\'t figure out how to
make images in a folder that will be immune to moving the markdown file
around.

Well I could host them online I guess but nah

It\'s worth bearing in mind that textbooks are gonna be seperate anyway.

I reckon have a folder corresponding to each format and have seperate
apps for different types of notes, then your set.

Also rstudio md export will be a problem.

This might not be necessary to think about because the following apps
will be released soon:

-   Boostnote
-   Notable
-   Joplin (after google summer of code)

And the problems I have to over come are too tricky:

-   \[ \] Make a markdown access a file even if it\'s moved across
    mobile and desktop (so relative won\'t work nor will absolute I need
    like a wild card)
-   \[ \] implement the rstudio markdown export into that.
