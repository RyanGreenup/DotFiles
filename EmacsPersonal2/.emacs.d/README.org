#+TITLE: My Emacs Config

* Design Decisions
** Package Manager
I was considering:

- [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package#installing-use-package][use-package]]
  - Very Modular
- [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d/blob/master/lisp/init-elpa.el][The Standard Package.el with magic lisp]]
  - No External Dependencies
  - Doesn't load from GitHub though
- [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#install-packages][Straight]]
- Bash Scripts / AUR / Pacman
  - This would require more configuring though

I went with straight because it can load from MELPA or GitHub and it
integrates with use-package.

** Listing Packages
Should I:

- Load the package in each =.el= file or
0 all together in one file?

I opted for all together in one file, that way it's easier to comment them
out, straight [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#how-do-i-uninstall-a-package][only loads]] what's mentioned so this seems really convenient
