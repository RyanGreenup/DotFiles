* TODO Reading

** TODO Bibliographic Details

** TODO Compare the Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion
   - [ ] Do they line up (i.e. agree?)
   - [ ] What is the paper arguing

** TODO Read throuh the Article and make notes about the claims
   - [ ] Is this interesting or useful?
   - [ ] Are the arguments correct?
    
** TODO How was the Evidence/Data collected?
   - [ ] Random Selection?
   - [ ] Appropriate cleaning?
   - [ ] Correct analysis
     
** TODO What theoretical Framework is being used to interpret the data
   
** TODO Include Page Numbers next to everything
   - [ ] Everything has page or section numbers?
   - [ ] Take Quotations where useful

** TODO Create a new link to document a tangentially related thought
     This is why backlinks are so useful

   
** TODO Answer the Following Questions

*** TODO Were the methods clearly explained?
*** TODO What claims do the authors say they are making?
*** TODO What claims did the authors actually make?
*** TODO How are the claims made?
*** TODO How well do the claims align with the methods?
*** TODO Are the methods appropriate?
*** TODO Are the underlying theoretical frameworks well grounded?
*** TODO Is the analysis and argument convincing
    i.e. don't let the data speak for itself.
** TODO Make further Reflective notes which summarise the text overall
* TODO Distilling
  Break the notes down into a ~SCMR~:
** TODO Summary
   - In two sentences concisely summarise the material
** TODO Claims
   - What are the Explicit claims made
** TODO Methods and Data
   - [ ] Explain the Evidence and Data
   - [ ] Make sure to explain the evidence that was used for the claims
   - [ ] How was the data analysed
   - [ ] Identify the following:
     - Evidence
     - Methodological Tools
     - Theoretical Framework
     - Practical Tools
* TODO Create a Discussion
  Now create a flowing discussion of that text in which the text is:

  - described
  - evaluated

  and your reflections on that text are recorded.

  There should be a tight constraint on this set before hand
  (e.g. \(\approx 200\) words.
