So that there isn't both a title and a main section

*** Add Snowflake as a decoration or title page?

** TODO tableofcontents
    ** TODO Mini toc per section
    ** TODO Not having multiple
** TODO MiniTOC
** TODO Rename Files
** TODO MakeFile or Build.sh
*** Makefile doesn't make much sense with latexmk
*** Build.sh is like a readme
** TODO Compile Seperate Documents
** TODO Images
    ** TODO Rename them all and add captions
** TODO Tikz
** TODO Index
** TODO README
*** TODO How to to TOC and Title
This needs to be done in a way that allows the toc to be attached to individual articles but the entire report only once.
