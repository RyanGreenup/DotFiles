Limits of Functions

Intuitively limits of functions are the expected value of a function at
points that can't be solved because they are undefined, e.g.\\
~\\
\(\frac{(x-2)\left( x+2 \right)}{\left( x-2 \right)}\) would be
undefined at x=2, however as x is made sufficiently close to 2, that
value will become arbitrarily close to 4.

The Limit Generally}{ The Limit Generally}}\label{the-limit-generally}}

From early calculus the limit of {f}({x}), as {x} approaches {a} was
said to be some value L, denoted
lim\textsubscript{{x} → {a}}({f}({x})) = {L}\\
\[\begin{aligned}
\forall \varepsilon > 0,
\enspace, \exists \delta:
& \notag \\ &
\qquad 0 < \lvert x-a
\rvert < \delta
\implies \lvert f\left( x
\right) - L \rvert <
\varepsilon
\label{stewartlimdef}\end{aligned}\]\\

Remarks on this
Definition\protect\hypertarget{remarks-on-this-definition}{}{}

Observe that the following statements are equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  \(x\neq c \enspace  \wedge \enspace \lvert  x-a \rvert < \delta\)
\item
  0 \textless{} \textbar{}{x} − {a}\textbar\textless{}{δ}
\item
  \textbar{}{x} − {a}\textbar∈(0,{δ})
\end{enumerate}

Notation\protect\hypertarget{notation}{}{}

~\\
~\\
If {L} is a limit of {f} at {c}, then it is said that:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  {f} converges to {L} at {c}
\item
  {f}({x}) approaches {L} as {x} approaches {c} This is sometimes
  expressed with the symbolism {f}({x}) → {L} as {x} → {c}
\end{enumerate}

~\\
And the following notation is used

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  lim\textsubscript{{x} → {c}}({f}({x})) = {L}
\item
  lim\textsubscript{{x} → {c}}{f}

The Limit Using Cluster
Points}{ The Limit Using Cluster Points}}\label{the-limit-using-cluster-points}}

In analysis we more or less use the same definition but we introduce the
concept of cluster points to make it more rigorous.

Neighborhoods {[}2.2.7{]}\protect\hypertarget{neighborhoods-2.2.7}{}{}

A neighborhood is an interval about a value, e.g. the {ε}-neighborhood
of {a} is some set {V}\textsubscript{{ε}}({a}):\\
\[\begin{aligned}
V_{\varepsilon}(a) = \left(
\varepsilon-a, \varepsilon+a
\right) &= \left\{ x :
\varepsilon - a < x <
\varepsilon + a \right\}
\\ &=
\left\{ x : -\varepsilon
< x - a < \varepsilon
\right\} \\
&= \left\{ x: \lvert x-a
\rvert < \varepsilon
\right\}
\label{nebhdef}\end{aligned}\]\\

Cluster Points\protect\hypertarget{cluster-points}{}{}

Let {c} be a real number and let {A} be a subset of the real numbers,
{c} may or may not be contained by {A} it doesn't matter.\\
Take some interval around {c}, or rather consider the {ε}-neighborhood
of {c},\\
if, some value (other than {c}) can be found inside that
interval/neighborhood that is also inside {A}, regardless of how small
that interval is made, Then {c} is said to be a cluster point of {A}.\\
~\\
i.e., if the following is true\\
\(\forall \varepsilon > 0, \enspace \exists x\neq c \in A\cap V_{\varepsilon}(c)\)\\
then {c} is said to be a cluster point of {A}.\\
~\\
It basically means that there are infinitely infinitesimal points
between any point in {A} and the value {c}.

Example

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The point 4 of the set \{3,4,5\} is not a cluster point of that set
  because a 0.1-neighbourhood of 4 would be the set
  {V}\textsubscript{0.1}(4)=\{4\}, this set does not contain a value
  {x} ≠ 4 that is also inside the original set.\\
\item
  The point 6 of (1,6) = \{{x}:1\textless{}{x}\textless6\} is a cluster
  point of (1,6) because no matter how small a neighborhood is made
  around 6, there will always be values {x} ≠ 6 inside that interval
  that are also inside (1,6) also observe that in this case 6 ∉ (1,6)
\end{itemize}

Definition of the Limit
{[}4.1.4{]}\protect\hypertarget{definition-of-the-limit-4.1.4}{}{}

So this is the definition that we moreso use in this unit and the one to
memorise (or the Neighborhoods one seems simpler to memorise).\\
~\\
Let {A} ⊆ ℝ and let {c} be a cluster point of {A}.\\
~\\
Now take some function:\\
\[\begin{aligned} f: A \rightarrow
\mathbb{R} \label{clustlimdeffunc}
\end{aligned}\]\\
It is said that {L} is a limit of {f} at {c} if:\\
\[\begin{aligned} \forall
\varepsilon > 0, &\enspace
\exists \delta > 0:
\notag \\
\qquad & \left( x \in A
\enspace \wedge \enspace
0<\lvert x-c \rvert <
\delta \right) \implies
\lvert f\left( x \right) -
L \rvert < \varepsilon
\tag{4.1.4} \label{414}
\end{aligned}\]\\

What's the Distinction

This is more or less the same as the typical definition given in early
calculus ({[}stewartlimdef{]}), the distinction here is that we have
specified that {c} must be a cluster point of {A}, this is more rigorous
because c is always such that there are infinitely many values in any
infinitesimal distance between intself and any {x} ∈ {A},\\
So the limit will always mean a continuous approach as we expect, this
is just a more thorough definition.

Definition using Neigborhoods
{[}4.1.6{]}\protect\hypertarget{definition-using-neigborhoods-4.1.6}{}{}

A value {L} is said to be the limit of {f} as {x} → {c}, denoted
lim\textsubscript{{x} → {c}}({f}({x})) if and only if:\\

2em0pt {For any} given {ε}-neighbourhood of {L},
\(\enspace V_{\varepsilon}(L)\)\\
{There exists} a {δ}-neighbourhood of {c},
\(\enspace V_{\delta}\left( L \right)\)\\

such that:~\\

4em0pt =0.7cm {If} {x} ≠ {c} is in both {A} and
{V}\textsubscript{{δ}}({c})\\
=0.5cm {Then} {f}({x}) must be within the neighbourhood
{V}\textsubscript{{ε}}({L})

Formally

\[\begin{aligned} \forall
\varepsilon > 0, & \enspace
\exists \delta > 0:
\notag \\ &
\qquad x \neq c, \enspace x
\in A\cap
V_{\varepsilon}\left( L
\right) \implies f\left( x
\right) \in
V_{\delta}\left( c
\right) \tag{4.1.6}
\label{416}\end{aligned}\]\\

Defintions ({[}416{]}) and ({[}414{]}) are equivalent, and are both
consistent with the initial less rigorous definition
({[}stewartlimdef{]}).

Only one Limit Value
{[}4.1.5{]}\protect\hypertarget{only-one-limit-value-4.1.5}{}{}

If {f} : {A} → ℝ and {c} is a cluster point of {A}, then there is only
one value L: lim\textsubscript{{x} → {c}}({f}({x})) = {L}

Now that limits are defined we can use sequences to define them as well,
this will give us more tools to use later and allows a connection to be
made between material of Chapter 3 and 4.

Definition\protect\hypertarget{definition}{}{}

A value {L} is said to be the limit of {f} as {x} → {c}, denoted
lim\textsubscript{{x} → {c}}({f}({x})) if and only if:\\

2em0pt {For every} sequence ({x}\textsubscript{{n}}) in {A},\\

4em0pt {if} ({x}\textsubscript{{n}}) converges to {c} such that
{x}\textsubscript{{n}} ≠ {c},\\

4em0pt {Then} ({f}({x}\textsubscript{{n}})) converges to {L}

~\\
So basically, again, if {x} gets close to {c}, {f}({x}) gets close to L,
but we took {x} from a sequence.

Now we can use the {Divergence Criteria} from {[}3.4.5{]} to determine
whether or not a limit exists generally or at a point.

(a) Limit is not a Specific

~\\
There is a sequence ({x}\textsubscript{{n}}) in {A} with
{x}\textsubscript{{n}} ≠ {c}, such that:\\
({x}\textsubscript{{n}}) converges to {c} but the sequence

Bounded Functions}{ Bounded Functions}}\label{bounded-functions}}

Definition\protect\hypertarget{definition-1}{}{}

Let {A} ⊆ ℝ, {f} : {A} → ℝ and let {c} ∈ ℝ be a cluster point of {A}.\\
It is said that {f is bounded on a neighbourhood of} {c} if:\\

2em0pt there exists a {δ}-neighborhood {V}\textsubscript{{δ}}({c}) and
some constant value {M} \textgreater{} 0 such that:\\

4em0pt \textbar{}{f}({x})\textbar≤{M} for every
{x} ∈ {A} ∩ {V}\textsubscript{{δ}}({c})

~\\
So basically a function is said to be {bounded on a neighbourhood of
{c}} if:

4em0pt for some interval (It doesn't matter how small) around {c},

6em0pt {f}({x}) can be contained in some interval

~\\

4em0pt \(\exists \delta>0, \enspace \exists M>0:\)

6em0pt
{x} ∈ {V}\textsubscript{{δ}}({c}) ⟹ \textbar{}{f}({x})\textbar\textless{}{M}

~\\
So for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {f}({x}) = {x}\textsuperscript{3} is {bounded on every neighborhood of
  every {x} ∈ ℝ} whereas,
\item
  \(g\left( x \right) =  \sfrac{1}{x}\) is {{not} bounded on a
  neighborhood of 0} because {g}({x}) tends to infinity as {x} → 0,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    furthermore {g}({x}) is {bounded on {some but notall} neighborhoods
    of 1}, because an interval around 1 must not be drawn large enough
    to encapsulate 0.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Limits imply Bounded Neighbourhoods {[}4.2.2
{]}\protect\hypertarget{limits-imply-bounded-neighbourhoods-4.2.2}{}{}

A function is bounded on a neighborhood of a point that is a limit of
that function.\\
If a function has a limit at {c}, then {f} must be {bounded on some
neighborhood of {c}},\\
this flows from the initial definitions because we know that {c} is a
cluster point and that ({f}({x})) moves closer to {L},\\
hence it must be possible to draw a small enough interval (e.g.
horizontal lines on the {y}-axis) to contain all {f}({x}) defined by

\hypertarget{functions-and-arithmetic-4.2.3}{%

Functions and Arithmetic

Functions and Arithmetic
{[}4.2.3{]}}{ Functions and Arithmetic {[}4.2.3{]}}}\label{functions-and-arithmetic-4.2.3}}

Just like with sequences we can define arithmetic operations that relate
to addition and multiplication with functions in order to manipulate
them:\\
~\\
Let {A} ⊆ ℝ ,\\
\[\begin{aligned} f: A \rightarrow
\mathbb{R} \qquad g: A
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\qquad h: A \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}, \enspace h(x)
\neq 0, \enspace \forall x
\in A
\label{seqdefgen}\end{aligned}\]\\

We define the following Operations {[}4.2, p. 111{]}:

\[\begin{aligned} {1} \left( f+g
\right) \left( x \right)
&:= f\left( x \right) +
g\left( x \right)
\label{addfundef} \\
\left( f-g \right) \left( x

\\ \left( bf
\right) \left( x \right)
&:= b \times f\left( x
\right) \label{confundef}
\\ \left(
\frac{f}{h}
\right)\left( x \right)
&:= \frac{f\left( x
\right)}{h\left( x
\right)} \end{aligned}\]\\

Limits of Function Operations {[}4.2.4{]}

Because the limit of a function is essentially the expected value of the
function around that value, it stands to reason that the limit will
distribute over the basic operations:\\
Let the functions be defined as they were in ({[}seqdefgen{]}) and let
{c} ∈ ℝ be a custer point of {A}.

\[\begin{aligned} \lim_{x
\rightarrow c}\left( f
\right) = L \qquad
\lim_{x \rightarrow
c}\left( g \right) = M
\quad \lim_{x\rightarrow
c}\left( h \right) = H
\neq 0
\label{fundeflim}\end{aligned}\]\\

Then the limits are:

\[\begin{aligned} {2}
\lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left( f+g \right) &=
\lim_{x\rightarrow
c}\left( f \right) +
\lim_{x\rightarrow

Squeeze Theorem
{[}4.2.7{]}\protect\hypertarget{squeeze-theorem-4.2.7}{}{}

if {[}4.2.6{]} is extended to functions, then we have the squeeze
theorem:\\
{if} {g} is within an interval defined by the functions {f} and {h}:

\[\begin{aligned} f\left( x
\right) \leq g\left( x
\right) \leq h\left( x
\right), \quad \forall
x\in A, \enspace x\neq c
\label{squeezelimdist}\end{aligned}\]\\

2em0pt {then} the limit of g must also be 0

A Positive Limit implies a neighbourhood with Positive
Values\protect\hypertarget{a-positive-limit-implies-a-neighbourhood-with-positive-values}{}{}

{If}:\\
\[\begin{aligned}

{Then:}

4em0pt there is a neighborhood {V}\textsubscript{{δ}}({c}) such that
\(f\left( x \right) >0, \enspace \forall x \in A \cap V_{\delta}\left( c \right)\)

~\\
This also holds for negative values and basically all it says, in more
rigorous language, is that if the limit point is above the {x}-axis then
there's gotta be points to the left and right that are above the
{x}-axis as well (because the whole cluster point thing means everything
can be arbitrarily small).\\
~\\
Although this may start to seem a little pointless, the idea of making
the definitions this rigorous is like writing code in a scripting
language, by using this very precise language, the logical consequences
give us exactly the concept that we want, even though we need to take a
longer or alternate path to get to that concept than we would otherwise
would generally take in order to describe the concept.

It is also useful to talk about limits as {x} tends to ∞

Let ({a},∞) ⊆ {A} ⊆ ℝ for some {ain}ℝ\\
It is aid that the limit of {f} as {x} → ∞ is {L}, and it is written:\\
\[\begin{aligned}
\lim_{x\rightarrow
\infty}\left( f \right) =
L \tag{4.3.10}
\label{4310}\end{aligned}\]\\

If \$ \textbackslash forall \textbackslash varepsilon \textgreater0,
\textbackslash enspace \textbackslash exists K \textgreater{} 0\$:

{x} \textgreater{} {K} ⟹ \textbar{}{f}({x}) − {L}\textbar\textless{}{ε}

Limits at Infinity in Terms of Sequences {[}4.3.11{]}

equivalently to ({[}4310{]}), the definition can be expressed in terms
of sequences:\\

2em0pt Every sequence ({x}\textsubscript{{n}}) in {A} ∩ ({a},∞) that has
lim({x}\textsubscript{{n}})=∞ is such that the sequence
({f}({x}\textsubscript{{n}})) converges to {L}

So this basically combines {[}4.3.10{]} with {[}4.3.5{]}

Let ({a},∞) ⊆ {A} ⊆ ℝ for some {a} ∈ ℝ\\
~\\
It is aid that {f} tends to ∞ as {x} → ∞, and it is written:\\
\[\begin{aligned}
\lim_{x\rightarrow
\infty}\left( f \right) =
\infty \tag{4.3.13}
\label{4313}\end{aligned}\]\\

If \$ \textbackslash forall \textbackslash varepsilon \textgreater0,
\textbackslash enspace \textbackslash exists K \textgreater{}
\textbackslash alpha\$:

6em0pt {x} \textgreater{} {K} ⟹ {f}({x}) \textgreater{} {α}

Infinite Limits at Infinity in Terms of Sequences {[}4.3.14{]}

equivalently to ({[}4313{]}), the definition can be expressed in terms
of sequences:\\

2em0pt Every sequence ({x}\textsubscript{{n}}) in {A} ∩ ({a},∞) that has
lim({x}\textsubscript{{n}})=∞ is such that the limit of the sequence of
function values lim ({f}({x}\textsubscript{{n}})) = ∞

Ratios of Functions

This result uses (4.3.14) to restate (3.6.5) in terms of functions:\\
If \(g\left( x \right) > 0 \enspace \forall x > a\) and {L} ≠ 0 is
defined:

\[\begin{aligned} lim_{x\rightarrow
\infty}\left(
\frac{f\left( x
\right)}{g\left( x
\right)} \right)
\tag{4.3.15}
\label{4315}\end{aligned}\]\\

then,

\[\begin{aligned} L > 0
\implies
\lim_{x\rightarrow
\infty}\left( f \right) =
\infty \iff \lim_{x
\rightarrow \infty \left( g
\right) = \infty}
\tag{4.3.15 (i)} \label{4315i}
\\ L < 0 \implies
\lim_{x\rightarrow
\infty}\left( f \right) =
- \infty \iff \lim_{x
\rightarrow \infty \left( g
\right) = \infty}
\tag{4.3.15 (ii)}
\label{4315ii}\end{aligned}\]\\
