#+TITLE: Readme

* Media
- All media goes in ~./media~
- Just use imagemagick as necessary:
  + ~convert -resize 400x400 -density 1000 -quality 95 file.png file.png~


** Tikz

- All Tikz goes in ~./media/tikz
- some tikz headers in org for TeXFrag
- The idea is (see [[http://ryansnotes.org/mediawiki/index.php/Create_Diagrams_as_SVG_using_Tikz#Seperate_Files_with_Standalone_.28Preferred.29][Tikz in Org Mode]])
* Referencing
- References are in ~./resources/references.bib~
- Instructions for references are in ~./resources/references.sty~
  + be careful because style sheet stuff needs bo te relative to the ~.tex~ file NOT  the ~sty~ sheet
    - This makes it confusing but seperating makes it easier to understand
- the line ~\addbibresource{./resources/references.bib}~ is inside the ~.org~ file because that way ~org-ref~ knows about it.
* Make File
So there is a makefile that automates exporting the ~org~:

- ~makefile_raw~ :: A makefile calling everything one by one
- ~makefile~     :: A makefile that checks the ~.org~ file to export it and then merely uses ~latexmk~


** Build File
** TODO Add the Logic for a HTML Export
- Make the ~html~ from pandoc
- Make the references using the ~bib~ file and a ~CSL~ file
** TODO Add the necessary elisp for org-ref to work so it all runs quicker
